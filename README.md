# Jeopardy - A dweb Production #

##Overview##

For project #1, I created a Jeopardy trivia game.

It is a one-player game but includes six separate categories and some of the clues include a visual element. If the player gets a question right, their score is added to depending on the value of the box clicked. If they do not answer correctly, their point total is reduced by the corresponding amount.
